Dungeons and Dragons 4.0 in Python
###################

Dungeons and Dragons 4.0 game implemented in Python.
My idea begins in a lot of stages of development in this order:

-Write the engine in Python, just the dnd 4.0 rules and pre-inserted races, classes, items...
-Begin with Console Game, just to test the rules, and play of course.
-Create a dynamic syntax to store the Campaigns in JSON files, maybe creating an editor to that.
-Create a GUI using PyGame or HTML5 & Django interface.
-I'm trying to figure out a multiplayer version.

Ok, I know, it's suicide! But, I'm not rushed.
