Dungeons and Dragons 5.0 game implemented in Python.
My idea begins in a lot of stages, in this order:

1. Write the engine in Python, just the dnd 5.0 rules and pre-inserted races, classes, items...
2. Begin with CLI Game, just to test the rules, and play of course.
3. Create a dynamic syntax to store the Campaigns in JSON files, maybe creating an editor to that.
4. Create a GUI using PyGame or HTML5 & Django interface.
5. I'm trying to figure out a multiplayer version.

So, don't expect a 3D MMORPG, just text cli or 2d like a 'RPG Maker game' is a good sample!

First of all, I'm writing the specs of the project in the [Project Wiki](https://github.com/jklemm/py-dnd/wiki/)
